## Memory Bloat

When code tries to allocate a lot of objects simultaneously.

**Where to find**: process big json or XML file in none streaming manner, or load a big number of objects from the database without batching.

**Symptoms**: "stepwise jumps" in memory.

## Ruby Leak

When reference to object lives longer than expected.

**Where to find**: caching, memoization, i18n.

**Examples**:

## Object Grinder

This is not commonly recognized as a memory issue, but it is one. Happens when code uses a lot of temporary objects, which leads to increased pressure on GC and to memory fragmentation.

**Where to find**: everywhere.

**Examples**:
- default arguments https://github.com/JuanitoFatas/fast-ruby/pull/137
- string literals without freeze (`# frozen_string_literal: true`)

**Symptoms**: logarithm-like memory growth.

## Memory Hog

Not commonly recognized as a memory issue, but it is one. Happens when code loads big sets of data and never unloads them.

**Where to find**: data gems.

**Examples**:
- https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/123
- https://github.com/RubyMoney/money/pull/691
- https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/pull/131
- https://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n/pull/391
